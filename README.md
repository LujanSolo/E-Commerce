## Description
  
In order to remain competitive in the e-commerce world, retail companies must be able to update their inventory quickly and easily. This fully-functional Express.js API uses Sequelize/MySql interface, and will allow the company's software developers to use their API-testing software (e.g. Postman, Thunder Client, Insomnia Core) to apply CRUD processes to the database.
